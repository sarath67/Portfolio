The Edge Line Crossing Safeguard stands at the forefront of autonomous vehicle safety systems, revolutionizing the way we approach obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Powered by cuttingedge technology and meticulous engineering, this project redefines the boundaries of vehicle safety in an increasingly autonomous world.



At its core, the Edge Line Crossing Safeguard is an autonomous vehicle safety system designed to mitigate the risks associated with edge line crossing and obstacle detection. Built upon the foundation of IoT and Embedded C, this system integrates ultrasonic and infrared sensors with Arduino microcontrollers to create a comprehensive safety net for vehicles navigating unpredictable environments.



The Edge Line Crossing Safeguard implements a dynamic algorithm that continuously monitors sensor data in realtime, allowing vehicles to swiftly detect and respond to obstacles in their path. By incorporating edge line crossing safeguards, the system enhances situational awareness and minimizes the risk of collisions, even in challenging driving conditions.



To uphold the highest standards of safety and reliability, the Edge Line Crossing Safeguard features a failsafe mechanism that activates in the event of system failure or unexpected circumstances. This failsafe mechanism serves as a critical safety net, ensuring that vehicles can safely navigate through diverse environments without compromising driver and passenger safety.



The Edge Line Crossing Safeguard represents a paradigm shift in autonomous vehicle safety, offering a robust and reliable solution for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. By leveraging IoT, Embedded C, and innovative sensor technology, this project paves the way for safer and more efficient transportation systems, driving us towards a future where autonomous vehicles can navigate with confidence and precision.
